For this project I have applied what I have learned so far in order to create a 2d shaped based Snake game. The game has been designed using GUI and it is user friendly. When the game starts, the snake is being drawn to a grid tile panel and the user can change its moving direction using AWSD Keys, Arrow Keys or Mouse Click. The purpose of the game is like any other normal snake game, to eat the food, which also is being drawn in the panel at random position, and survive as much as possible without hitting on the walls or touching its own body. The user can change the gameâ€™s difficulty, so the harder the difficulty is, the faster the snake will move, and the more points will be collected when eating the fruit. When the game starts, a fun music starts playing but there is always the option to mute it and unmute it any time. The same applies to the sound that is being made when the snake eats a fruit. Also, the user has the option to turn the game into dark mode, changing the colors of the whole interface or change back into the light color shades. When the game ends, the panel with all the drawings is being cleared and the top 10 scores of all time are being printed.
